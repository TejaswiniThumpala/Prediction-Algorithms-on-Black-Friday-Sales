# Prediction-Algorithms-on-Black-Friday-Sales
This project examines and uses the Machine Learning algorithms to build a precise model to predict the purchase amount of customer paid for various products which will help retail stores to better understand the customer purchase behaviour, analyses the customersâ€™ favourite products based on their purchases and creates a personalized offer for each customer against their preferred products. The dataset used for the project is about customer purchases obtained from a shopping mall during one of its busiest days: Black Friday.
